# Programming Computer Vision

This was a project that was inspired by [Programming Computer Vision with Python by Jan Erik Solem](http://programmingcomputervision.com/downloads/ProgrammingComputerVision_CCdraft.pdf). For every directory in the PCV directory with chapter in the name has code in the tutorial.

For the more interesting projects go to the ex directories. They have my own code used to complete the challenges that at the end of each chapter.

## Chapter 1
This chapter focussed in filters and the underlying algorithms used to blur/sharpen them.

For example 1:
