1. Take an image and apply Gaussian blur like in Figure 1.9. Plot the image
contours for increasing values of  . What happens? Can you explain why?

2. Implement an unsharp masking operation
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_masking) by blurring an image and then
subtracting the blurred version from the original. This gives a sharpening
effect to the image. Try this on both color and grayscale images.

3. An alternative image normalization to histogram equalization is a quotient
image. A quotient image is obtained by dividing the image with a blurred
version I/(I â‡¤ G ). Implement this and try it on some sample images.

4. Write a function that finds the outline of simple objects in images
(for example a square against white background) using image gradients.

5. Use gradient direction and magnitude to detect lines in an image. Estimate
the extent of the lines and their parameters. Plot the lines overlaid on the
image.

6. Apply the label() function to a thresholded image of your choice. Use
histograms and the resulting label image to plot the distribution of object
sizes in the image.

7. Experiment with successive morphological operations on a thresholded image
of your choice. When you have found some settings that produce good results,
try the function center_of_mass in morphology to find the center coordinates
of each object and plot them in the image.
